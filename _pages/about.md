<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I’m Tongxin Li (李童欣 in Chinese), and I also go by Lily — a name inspired by my love for [Monet’s Water Lilies](https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1960.81) 🪷. 

I’m currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Informatics](https://informatics.njit.edu/) at the [Ying Wu College of Computing](https://computing.njit.edu/), [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/) ❤️, where I work with my advisor [Dr. Donghee Yvette Wohn](https://yvettewohn.com/) in the [Social X Lab](https://socialinteractionlab.com/) 🔍.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Media and Information and a Master’s degree in Digital Communication and Media from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) 💚.

My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I use mixed-method approaches, integrating quantitative and qualitative methods to understand how people perceive and engage with technology in complex, context-dependent ways. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jBreGf0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=white&color=blue&style=for-the-badge&label=Google%20Scholar"></a>
