I am Tongxin Li (李童欣 in Chinese), also go by Lily. I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Informatics](https://informatics.njit.edu/) in [Ying Wu College of Computing](https://computing.njit.edu/) of [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/) ❤️, working with [Dr. Donghee Yvette Wohn](https://yvettewohn.com/) at the [Social X Lab](https://socialinteractionlab.com/). with a background enriched by a Bachelor’s degree in Media and Information and a Master’s degree in Digital Communication and Media from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) 💚. 

My research leverages mixed-method approaches, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies to uncover the nuanced dynamics in which people engage with and perceive emerging technologies. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jBreGf0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>
