<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, with a background enriched by a Bachelor’s degree in Media and Information and a Master’s degree in Digital Communication and Media from Michigan State University. 

My research leverages mixed-method approaches, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies to uncover the nuanced dynamics in which people engage with and perceive emerging technologies.
