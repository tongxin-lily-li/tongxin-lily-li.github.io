Hi, I’m Tongxin Li (李童欣 in Chinese), and I also go by Lily — a name inspired by my love for [Monet’s Water Lilies](https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1960.81) 🪷. 

I’m currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Informatics](https://informatics.njit.edu/) at the [Ying Wu College of Computing](https://computing.njit.edu/), [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/) ❤️, where I work with my advisor [Dr. Donghee Yvette Wohn](https://yvettewohn.com/) in the [Social X Lab](https://socialinteractionlab.com/) 🔍.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Media and Information and a Master’s degree in Digital Communication and Media from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) 💚.

I use mixed-method approaches, integrating quantitative and qualitative methods to understand how people perceive and engage with technology in complex, context-dependent ways.
